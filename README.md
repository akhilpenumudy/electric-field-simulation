## Project Overview
This project is an interactive web-based simulation of electric fields and potentials. It provides a dynamic, visual representation of electromagnetic phenomena, allowing users to explore and understand complex electrostatic concepts through real-time interaction.
Features

Interactive Charge Placement: Users can add positive and negative charges to the simulation area.
Dynamic Field Visualization: Electric field lines are rendered in real-time, updating as charges are added or moved.
Potential Mapping: A color-coded potential map illustrates the electric potential throughout the simulation space.
Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Charges can be moved freely within the simulation, with field lines and potential maps updating instantly.
Multi-Charge Scenarios: Support for multiple charges, demonstrating principles like superposition.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the user interface and managing application state.
- HTML5 Canvas: Used for rendering the simulation graphics.
- JavaScript: Core programming language for simulation logic and interactivity.
